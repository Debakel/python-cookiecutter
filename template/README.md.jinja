## Documentation

Design and other technical decisions relevant to this application are listed in
an [Architecture Decision Record](docs/decisions/0000-decision-record.md), which can be found [here](docs/decisions).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisite

The setup requires:

* [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to install and manage dependencies
* [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install the required python version

If _pyenv_ is not installed, you must install Python {{python_version}} manually.

### Installation

To install all python dependencies, run:

    pipenv install --dev

### Usage

    python -m {{package_name}} 42

### Docker

If you prefer using Docker for containerized setup:

    docker build -t {{package_name}} .
    docker run {{package_name}}

## Code Quality

We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) together with [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) to enforce a consistent
code style, conformity with [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) and other code quality standards.

To add the git hooks to your local repository run:

    pre-commit install

This will install a pre-commit hook that rejects the commit if the staged changes do not satisfy our code quality
standards.

To trigger the checks manually, run:

    pre-commit run --all-files

## Tests

Unit tests can be run with:

    pytest
